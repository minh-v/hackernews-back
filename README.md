help/questions:
query from browser directly with in memory jwt?
store jwt on browser? attach to apollo client requests?
or call express route, and read the cookie that's attached from there to authenticate

Iâ€™ve set up my user authentication using a jwt generated from the token that magic provides, and am storing it in an HTTPonly cookie on the browser. I'm not sure about the best way to use that token to authenticate my queries/mutations. Right now I have the browser send a request to a route on the server, and I handle the cookie and send my graphql requests from there. But this means that I can't send graphql requests from the browser with the token (only unauthenticated access). I've looked into trying to attach the token to the auth header on the apollo client, but am running into a block. I'm not sure if this even matters.
